## About the Collection

The Places in Afghanistan collection shows and describes different areas of Afghanistan. The collection features photos captured from a relatives' travels to the country, between the years of 2017-2018, through a smartphone camera. The collection displays landmark, landscape, animal, and scenic photos from cities and towns in Afghanistan. 

I hope you enjoy viewing the Places in Afghanistan collection!

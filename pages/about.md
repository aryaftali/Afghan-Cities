## About the Collection

This collection shows and describes different areas of Afghanistan. The collection features photos taken from a relatives' travels there. The images were taken on a smartphone camera between the years of 2017 through 2018. It includes landmark, landscape, animal, and scenic photos from cities and towns in Afghanistan. 

I hope you enjoy viewing the Cities and Towns of Afghanistan collection!
